# Angular API

This is a simple application which demonstrates Angular's ability to easily retrieve JSON data from an API and serve it to the DOM. This version of the application contains example user data and post data. Future iterations will have a more diverse set of data.

## To-Do

- Add an About page
- Include other HTTP functionality (such as `POST` or `DELETE`)
- Expand user card with more info when user clicks user card
